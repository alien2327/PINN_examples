# Introduction

Since the introduction of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) by Raissi et al. (2019), there has been a significant upsurge in interest in the PINNs technique, spanning various scientific fields. Notably, this technique offers several advantages, such as numerical simplicity compared to conventional schemes. Despite not excelling in terms of performance (accuracy and training computing time), PINNs present a compelling alternative for addressing challenges that prove difficult for traditional methods, such as inverse problems or parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). For comprehensive reviews, refer to Coumo et al. (2022) and Karniadakis et al. (2021).

In this article, I introduce a tutorial on the PINNs technique applied to PDEs containing terms based on the Laplacian in two dimensions (2D), extending the previous tutorial work applied to ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by Baty & Baty (2023). More precisely, I focus on solving different Poisson-type equations called Grad-Shafranov equations and representing magnetic equilibria in magnetically dominated plasmas (e.g. the solar corona), following some examples presented in Baty & Vigon (2024) and also other well known examples (see Cerfon et al. 2011). Additionally, PDEs representative of two dimensional internal star structures are also solved, extending a previous work in a one dimensional approximation (Baty 2023a, Baty 2023b). The latter equations are generally called Lane-Emden equations in the literature. Note that, not only direct problems are considered but also inverse problems for which we seek to obtain an unknown term in the equation. Of course, for these latter problems, additional data on the solutions is required.
