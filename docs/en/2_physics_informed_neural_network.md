## Problem statement for 2D direct problems

We consider a partial differential equation (PDE) written in the following residual form as, 
$$
F=0,
$$
where u(x) denotes the desired solution and ux, uy, ... are the required associated partial derivatives of different orders with respect to x and y. Specific conditions must be also imposed at the domain boundary D depending on the problem (see below in the paper).
